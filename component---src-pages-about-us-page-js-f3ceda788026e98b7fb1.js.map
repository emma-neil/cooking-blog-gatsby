Welcome to our cooking blog. We\n          (Emma and Myriam) are so excited to have a single platform to share\n          the food we make with all the people we love. We both find a lot of\n          joy in cooking. Emma has learned a lot about love while watching\n          Myriam prepare and eat meals with friends. For anyone who has shared\n          one of those meals with us, you know we're not experts, and we don't\n          aim for fine dining. We like simple food, creative food, fresh food,\n          colorful food, and good company with which to eat it. Quarantine gave\n          the two of us the chance to cook together again. Many of our friends\n          and family have also chosen to spend more time cooking together, and\n          have taken the time to try new recipes. What better time to start a\n          cooking blog?\n        </p>\n\n        <br />\n\n        <p>\n          Besides this, Emma is declaring a major in Computer Science and\n          decided to make the blog from scratch as a way to practice her Web\n          Development skills. Please excuse the primitive design of the website!\n          She's working on it:)\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          If you have any recipe suggestions (family favorites, an interesting\n          discovery, something you tried at a friend's house, etc.) we would\n          love to try them!
